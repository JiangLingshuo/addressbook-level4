==== Justification

* Having a "sort" command allows our users to list contacts in the address book in the order that they desire.
This can be useful as the user may want to view contacts in alphabetical order, or sorted by their email addresses.

* The Group System is meant to be a total overhaul and improvement over the tagging system. Tags do not show you
at a glance which other contacts share the same tags as the current one, nor are they intuitive in terms of managing contacts
as a 'group'. With the group feature, a user can see at one glance the group members in the same group and add, remove
them in a intuitive manner.

* Having a `cadd` command which pulls events from Google Calendar for a contact is useful and meaningful as people tend to keep
track of their schedule through a calendar of some sort and Google Calendar is a commonly used service.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting
The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand`, which extends `UndoableCommand`.
It supports the sorting of persons in the address book by the `PREFIX` specified.
If the `r` flag is specified, the list of persons will be sorted in descending order.

`SortCommand` would return a `Comparator` depending on the `PREFIX` specified through this code snippet:
[source,java]
----
private Comparator<ReadOnlyPerson> getSortComparator(String field) {
        return (o1, o2) -> {
            /** Person(s) marked as 'Favourite' will always remain at the top of the list **/
            if (o1.getFavourite().getStatus()) {
                if (isReverseOrder) {
                    /** Ensure 'Favourite' persons is always greater than when sorted in descending order**/
                    return 1;
                } else {
                    /** Ensure 'Favourite' persons is always smaller than when sorted in ascending order**/
                    return -1;
                }
            }

            switch (field) {
            case PREFIX_NAME_FIELD:
                this.sortBy = "name";
                return o1.getName().toString()
                        .compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getName().toString()
                        );

            case PREFIX_PHONE_FIELD:
                this.sortBy = "phone";
                return o1.getPhone().toString()
                        .compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getPhone().toString()
                        );

            case PREFIX_EMAIL_FIELD:
                this.sortBy = "email";
                return o1.getEmail().toString()
                        .compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getEmail().toString()
                        );

            case PREFIX_ADDRESS_FIELD:
                this.sortBy = "address";
                return o1.getAddress().toString()
                        .compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getAddress().toString()
                        );

            default:
                this.sortBy = "name";
                return o1.getName().toString()
                        .compareToIgnoreCase(o2.getName().toString()
                        );
            }
        };

    }
----
A person marked as *'Favourite'* will always be given priority during sorting to ensure consistency of the `Favourite` feature as
*'Favourite'* persons should always stay at the top of the contact list to locate them easily.
Thereafter, the sorting of persons occur in `UniquePersonList`, where a call to `Collections.sort` is
made with the respective comparator and an `isReverse` boolean flag as parameters.

The sort feature is implemented in `UniquePersonList` in this manner:
[source,java]
----
public void sort(Comparator sortComparator, Boolean isReverseOrder) throws NoPersonsException {
        requireNonNull(sortComparator);
        requireNonNull(isReverseOrder);

        if (internalList.size() < 1) {
            throw new NoPersonsException();
        }

        Collections.sort(internalList, sortComparator);

        if (isReverseOrder) {
            Collections.reverse(internalList);
        }
    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of program execution when a `SortCommand` is executed by the user:

image::SortPersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort n/r` Command_

The execution of `sort` results in the reordering of the in-memory `UniquePersonList`.
The change is transient and the order of the list will return to its
original starting order as when the application starts up.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `sort` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort persons through `UniquePersonList` +
**Pros:** Imputes responsibility of sorting to `UniquePersonList`, which is the class person list is declared from. +
This results in fine-grained, total control over anything to do with a person list and future implementations
will be easier and more complete. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the flow of sorting execution. +
**Alternative 2:** Perform `sort` at `ModelManager` or `AddressBook` level +
**Pros:** New developers will have an easier time tracing the sort execution flow. +
**Cons:** `ModelManager` or `AddressBook` will be highly coupled with the sort function and
any future changes to these classes may be more contrived and difficult.

---

**Aspect:** Sort Persistence +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The address book is not saved after sorting. +
**Pros:** Users may want to sort for their current session only. +
**Cons:** Sorting order is not retained when the program exits. +
**Alternative 2:** Save address book after every sort +
**Pros:** Sorting order is preserved after program exits. +
**Cons:** The original order of the address book is lost during every sort.

---

**Aspect:** Sorting `Favourite` Person(s) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Favourite` person(s) are not subjected to sorting. +
**Pros:** Presents a coherent and uniform `Favourite` feature as `Favourite` person(s) should always be found at the top of the list. +
**Cons:** A user is unable to sort every person according to the `PREFIX` specified. +
**Alternative 2:** `Favourite` person(s) are subjected to sorting. +
**Pros:** A user is able to sort every person according to the `PREFIX` specified, regardless of the `Favourite` status. +
**Cons:** `Favourite` person(s) will not remain at the top of the list after a user sorts the address book.
// end::sort[]

// tag::group[]
=== Groups
The `Group` suite of features are implemented by creating a new `Group` model with its constituent components as shown in the class
diagram below:

image::GroupClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.1 : Class Diagram for `Group`_

A `Group` is composed of a `GroupName` and `UniquePersonList` which is responsible for storing group members.
The Groups in address book are contained in `UniqueGroupList`, which exposes itself through a
`FilteredGroupList` in the `Model`. All groups commands are performed through the `Model` where the
`UniqueGroupList` is accessed to either create groups, delete groups, add person(s) to groups or remove
person(s) from groups.

==== Creating and Deleting Groups
The create and delete group mechanism is facilitated by `CreateGroupCommand` and `DeleteGroupCommand` respectively, which extends `UndoableCommand`.
The `CreateGroupCommand` allows a user to create a group with a desired `GroupName` specified by the
`n/` flag while the
`DeleteGroupCommand` allows a user to delete a group at the specified `INDEX`.

The `CreateGroupCommand` interfaces with `ModelManager`, which exposes the `UniqueGroupList` and is implemented in this manner:
[source,java]
----
public void addGroup(ReadOnlyGroup group) throws DuplicateGroupException {
        addressBook.addGroup(group);
        updateFilteredGroupList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_GROUPS);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
----

A `DuplicateGroupException` is thrown if a duplicate `Group` is added to `UniqueGroupList`.

Similarly, the `DeleteGroupCommand` interfaces with `ModelManager`, which exposes the `UniqueGroupList` and is implemented in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
    public void deleteGroup(ReadOnlyGroup target) throws GroupNotFoundException {
        addressBook.removeGroup(target);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
----

A `GroupNotFoundException` is thrown if the `Group` speicfied by the `INDEX` is not found in
`UniqueGroupList`.

Both creating and deleting groups result in a change in the model of the address book, and these
changes are saved to storage as well.
The following sequence diagram captures the program flow when a user creates a group:

image::CreateGroupSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2a : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `gcreate n/Bamboo` Command_

Similarly, the following sequence diagram captures the program flow when a user deletes a group:

image::DeleteGroupSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.2b : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `gdelete 1` Command_

==== Adding and removing a person from a Group
The `AddPersonToGroupCommand` and `RemovePersonFromGroupCommand`, which extends `UndoableCommand`, is
responsible for adding and removing a person from a group.
Both commands allow a user to add or remove a person from a group by specifying a `PERSON INDEX` through the
`p/` flag and a `GROUP INDEX` through a `g/` flag.

Both `AddPersonToGroupCommand` and `RemovePersonFromGroupCommand` both interfaces with `ModelManager`,
which exposes `UniqueGroupList` and its corresponding `UniquePersonList` and
they are implemented in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
public void addPersonToGroup(Index targetGroup, ReadOnlyPerson toAdd)
            throws GroupNotFoundException, PersonNotFoundException, DuplicatePersonException {
        addressBook.addPersonToGroup(targetGroup, toAdd);
        indicateAddressBookChanged();
    }
----
`GroupNotFoundException`, `PersonNotFoundException` and `DuplicatePersonException` are thrown
in the event the `Group` specified does not exist, or if `Person` specified is not found, or
if a duplicate `Person` exists in the `UniquePersonList` in the group.

[source,java]
----
    public void deletePersonFromGroup(Index targetGroup, ReadOnlyPerson toRemove)
            throws GroupNotFoundException, PersonNotFoundException, NoPersonsException {
        addressBook.deletePersonFromGroup(targetGroup, toRemove);
        /** Update filtered list with predicate for current group members in group after removing a person */
        ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> personList = addressBook.getGroupList()
                .get(targetGroup.getZeroBased()).groupMembersProperty().get().asObservableList();
        updateFilteredPersonList(getGroupMembersPredicate(personList));
        indicateAddressBookChanged();

    }
----
`GroupNotFoundException`, `PersonNotFoundException` and `NoPersonsException` are thrown
in the event the `Group` specified does not exist, or if `Person` specified is not found, or
if the `UniquePersonList` in the `Group` specified is empty.

Both adding and removing a person from a group will result in a change in the model of the address book, and these
changes are saved to storage as well.

The following sequence diagram captures the program flow when a user adds a person to a group:

image::AddPersonToGroupSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.3a : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `gadd p/1 g/1` Command_

The following sequence diagram captures the program flow when a user removes a person from a group:

image::AddPersonToGroupSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.3.3b : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `gremove p/1 g/1` Command_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `Group` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a completely new `Group` model. +
**Pros:** Creating a completely new `Group` Model gives the developer fine-grained control
over a `Group` and logically separates `Group` from a `Tag`, which makes implementation
of `Group` commands distinct from `Tag` commands. This allows a developer to freely extend
and add new `Group` commands without affecting or being confined by the `Tag` model. +
**Cons:** It takes alot of time to create and integrate a new `Group` model. +
**Alternative 2:** Modify the `Tag` model to perform 'Group-like` functions.  +
**Pros:** Less time is needed to modify `Tag` and integration of new commands will be simple. +
**Cons:** The `Tag` model does not provide a clear and logical separation of duties for
`Group` functions and is limited in its structure to allow fine-grained control over
the addition and removal of 'members'.
// end::group[]

// start::schedule[]
=== Schedule
To allow a user to pull events from Google Calendar, add and remove events, a `Schedule` model is created with its constituent components as shown in the class diagram below:

image::ScheduleClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1 : Schedule Class Diagram_

A `Schedule` is composed of a `ScheduleName` and a `ScheduleDate`. Every `Person` in address book
has a `UniqueScheduleList`, which contains a list of `Schedule` objects. A `Schedule` is accessed
by accessing the `UniqueScheduleList` of a person through the `UniquePersonList` maintained in
`ModelManager`.

A `googlecalendarutil` package is created and it contains helper methods to query the
Google Calendar API, parse `JSON` reponses and the corresponding datetime strings.

==== Adding events from a person's Google Calendar
To obtain events from a person's Google Calendar, `EventParserUtil` and `ServiceHandlerUtil` are used.
`EventParserUtil` queries `https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/` with a user's specified
`CALENDAR_ID` and parses the corresponding `JSON` response as shown in the code snippet below:
[source,java]
----
public static UniqueScheduleList getScheduleList(String calendarId) throws IOException, IllegalValueException {
        UniqueScheduleList scheduleList = new UniqueScheduleList();
        String apiUrl = API + calendarId + QUERY + KEY;
        String response = ServiceHandlerUtil.makeCall(apiUrl);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        JsonNode root = mapper.readTree(response);
        JsonNode events = root.at(EVENTS);
        for (JsonNode event: events) {
            scheduleList.add(getSingleSchedule(event));
        }
        return scheduleList;

    }
----
If the `CALENDAR_ID` is valid, Google responds with a `JSON` response that is subsequently parsed and used
to construct a `UniqueScheduleList` comprising of `Schedule` objects.

The Google Calendar API is accessed by a `HTTP GET` which is implemented in `ServiceHandlerUtil` as shown
below:
----
public static String makeCall(String url) throws IOException {

        URL obj = new URL(url);

        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
        connection.setRequestMethod("GET");

        return getResponseString(connection);

    }
----

After obtaining a `UniqueScheduleList` from `EventParserUtil`, a call to updatePerson is made
with a new `UniqueSheduleList` inserted into the edited person.
The sequence diagram below captures the program flow when an add calendar command is executed:

image::AddCalendarSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.2 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cadd` Command_

==== Adding and removing events
The add and remove event mechanism is facilitated by `AddEventCommand` and `DeleteEventCommand` respectively.
A helper method is called in these commands to add or remove an event and is implemented as such:
----
    private Person addEventToPerson(ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit, String personName) throws ParseException {
        Name updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
        Phone updatedPhone = personToEdit.getPhone();
        Email updatedEmail = personToEdit.getEmail();
        Address updatedAddress = personToEdit.getAddress();
        ProfPic updatedProfPic = personToEdit.getProfPic();
        Favourite updatedFavourite = personToEdit.getFavourite();
        Set<Tag> updatedTags = personToEdit.getTags();
        Set<Group> updatedGroups = personToEdit.getGroups();
        UniqueScheduleList updatedScheduleList = personToEdit.scheduleProperty().get();
        Set<SocialMedia> updatedSocialMediaList = personToEdit.getSocialMedia();

        try {
            updatedScheduleList.add(this.schedule);
        } catch (DuplicateScheduleException e) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_SCHEDULE, personName));
        }

        /** Ensure scheduleList is in order **/
        updatedScheduleList.sort();
        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress, updatedFavourite,
                updatedProfPic, updatedTags, updatedGroups, updatedScheduleList.toSet(), updatedSocialMediaList);
    }
----
A `DuplicateScheduleException` is thrown if an identical `Schedule` is present in the
person's `UniqueScheduleList`. Afterwhich, `updatePerson` in `ModelManager` is invoked to update
the person with the updated `UniqueScheduleList`.

Similarly, a helper method is called to remove event(s) from a person in `DeleteEventCommand` as such:
----
private Person removeEventFromPerson(ReadOnlyPerson personToEdit) throws ParseException {
        Name updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
        Phone updatedPhone = personToEdit.getPhone();
        Email updatedEmail = personToEdit.getEmail();
        Address updatedAddress = personToEdit.getAddress();
        Favourite updatedFavourite = personToEdit.getFavourite();
        ProfPic updatedProfPic = personToEdit.getProfPic();
        Set<Tag> updatedTags = personToEdit.getTags();
        Set<Group> updatedGroups = personToEdit.getGroups();
        UniqueScheduleList updatedScheduleList = personToEdit.scheduleProperty().get();
        Set<SocialMedia> updatedSocialMediaList = personToEdit.getSocialMedia();

        if (updatedScheduleList.asObservableList().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_NO_EVENTS, updatedName.fullName));
        }

        ReadOnlySchedule[] schedulesToDelete = new ReadOnlySchedule[eventIndexes.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < eventIndexes.length; i++) {
            try {
                schedulesToDelete[i] = updatedScheduleList.asObservableList().get(eventIndexes[i].getZeroBased());
            } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_NO_SUCH_EVENT);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < eventIndexes.length; i++) {
            try {
                updatedScheduleList.remove(schedulesToDelete[i]);
            } catch (ScheduleNotFoundException e) {
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_NO_SUCH_EVENT);
            }
        }

        return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, updatedEmail, updatedAddress,
                updatedFavourite, updatedProfPic, updatedTags, updatedGroups,
                updatedScheduleList.toSet(), updatedSocialMediaList);
    }
----
A `ScheduleNotFoundException` is thrown if a specified `Schedule` is not present in the
person's `UniqueScheduleList`. Afterwhich, `updatePerson` in `ModelManager` is invoked to update
the person with the updated `UniqueScheduleList`.

The follow sequence diagrams capture the program flow during the execution of add event and delete event
respectively:

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of pulling events from Google Calendar +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Access Google Calendar API with an `API KEY` +
**Pros:** The developer's `API KEY` can be used to obtain events for every user without +
the user having to log in. +
**Cons:** Using an `API KEY` only allows for limited Google Calendar functionality
and there is no way to add or remove events to a user securely or easily. +
**Alternative 2:** Log in to Google and access an oAuth token to access Google Calendar API.  +
**Pros:** Functionality such as adding or removing events from a user securely can be implemented. +
**Cons:** Coding the login function to Google is highly involved and tedious. +
